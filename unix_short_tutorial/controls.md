Positive and Negative Controls in DNA Metabarcoding
===================================================

**Negative Controls** are process controls designed to avoid environmental contamination.  
1. You can use a _white_ sample (water);
2. You may test your reagents and primers;
3. You may test your lab devices and benches. 

**Positive Controls** are designed to verify the experimental procedure works correctly.
